# YouTube Viewing Pattern Analysis: A Personal Insight

## 🎯 Objective

This analysis explores my YouTube viewing trends over a specific period, with the goal of understanding behavioral shifts and identifying moments that deviate from the norm. The primary aim is not only to uncover which channels I engaged with most, but also to reflect on what those patterns might indicate about my mental state or situational context.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

* **Data Source**: My YouTube watch/subscription history.
* **Preprocessing**: Extracted view counts grouped by `year_month` and `channel`, and transformed into a pivot table.
* **Focus Channels**: \['1분순삭', 'AKA', '리쥬라이크 LIJULIKE', '시간 훅 가는 쇼츠', '태요미네']

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1. 리쥬라이크 LIJULIKE was my dominant channel

* Across the entire timeline, this channel consistently maintained the highest share of views.
* Its content likely resonated with my steady emotional or motivational state during this period.

### 2. 2025 saw a notable shift: AKA suddenly surged

* Starting in 2025, AKA’s viewing share sharply increased.
* This kind of deviation often signals a shift in mood, interest, or situation.
* It’s likely that a personal event or life phase triggered a preference change.

### 3. Visualization Highlights

* A horizontal stacked bar chart was used to clearly show the percentage share each channel had per month.
* Custom color mapping was applied to ensure consistent visual identification of each channel.

## 🤔 Reflection on Data Approach

### What worked well:

* The purpose-driven approach helped generate meaningful interpretation.
* Vectorized calculations in Pandas made the percentage analysis efficient and reproducible.
* Highlighting specific time-based changes led to valuable personal insights.

### What could improve:

* **Channel names** are too personalized; for broader understanding, I should have categorized them (e.g., education, entertainment, vlog).
* **리쥬라이크**, though central to my pattern, wasn’t visually emphasized as much as it could have been.

### Improvement Ideas:

* Add a new column with manually assigned categories.
* Aggregate and visualize viewing behavior by category.
* Create a focused timeline line chart for 리쥬라이크 and AKA to track shifts more clearly.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

This project isn’t just about YouTube stats. It’s a reflection tool.
By visualizing what I consumed over time, I can indirectly trace emotional cycles, phases of productivity, or even burnout.

In portfolios, this stands out because it connects **data with human context**—which is the true power of data analysis.

## 🗂️ Next Steps

1. Add a category classification for each channel.
2. Write a short narrative about what might have changed in 2025.
3. Turn this into a Medium blog post for broader storytelling appeal.

## 🔗 Tools Used

* Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
* Jupyter Notebook
* Visual Style: Custom color mapping and horizontal stacked bar chart

## ✅ Summary

This project serves as a meaningful and personalized data analysis piece. It translates raw behavioral data into insightful visual storytelling, tying together emotion, time, and digital consumption. It's not just portfolio-worthy — it's memorable.
