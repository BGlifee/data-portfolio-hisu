# Heesoo's Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my data portfolio. My goal is to explore data in meaningful, creative ways while building practical skills in analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Each project is guided by curiosity, real-world relevance, and a habit of reflection.

## 🔭 Projects Overview

1. **[Wine Quality Prediction](./wine-quality)**  
   A classic regression problem where I tested multiple models and learned the impact of feature scaling and outlier removal.

2. **[Glassdoor Job Analysis](./glassdoor-jobs)**  
   A job market study to understand trends in data analyst postings — what skills are in demand and how salaries vary.

3. **[My YouTube Subscription Patterns](./youtube-subscription)**  
   A personal data dive into my own viewing habits. This project uses clustering to explore content categories and time trends.
